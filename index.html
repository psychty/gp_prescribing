      <h1>GP Practice Prescribing - West Sussex</h1>
      <p>Information on the drugs or appliances prescribed by NHS services each month are available from NHS Digital under the Open Government Licence.</p>
      <p>Item figures tell us the <strong>number of times a medicine has been prescribed</strong> but do not provide any indication of the length of treatment or quantity of medicine prescribed. Patients with a long term condition usually get regular prescriptions and whilst many prescriptions are for one month (28 or 30 days supply), items will be for varying lengths of treatment and quantity.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, the data cannot tell us about an individual prescription and doesn't contain any patient identifiable data, but it does give an indication on the prescribing patterns among primary care organisations.</p>

      <h2>Exploring chapters</h2>
      <p>This visualisation shows the number of items prescribed in 2018 for the three West Sussex CCGs using categories in the British National Formulary (BNF).</p>
      <p>The size of the circle represents the number of items prescribed for that category of items. Items are grouped by the broad section of the BNF in which they are classified.</p>
      <p>Use the buttons below to select a BNF chapter and hover over a circle to see the category of items.</p>

      <h2>Notes:</h2>
      <p>The data includes prescriptions written by GPs and prescriptions written by non-medical prescribers who are attached to GP practices such as nurses, pharmacists, optometrists, chiropodists and radiographers. The data does not cover private prescriptions.</p>
      <p>A prescription item refers to a single supply of a medicine, dressing or appliance prescribed on a prescription form. If a prescription form includes three medicines it is counted as three prescription items.</p>
      <p>It should also be noted that these figures do not give any indication of the length of treatment or quantity of medicine prescribed and it says nothing about whether or not a prescribed medicine was taken.</p>
