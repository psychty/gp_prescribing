        <h2>Notes:</h2>
        <p>A prescription item refers to a single supply of a medicine, dressing or appliance prescribed on a prescription form. If a prescription form includes three medicines it is counted as three prescription items. These figures do not give any indication of the length of treatment or quantity of medicine prescribed.</p>
        <p>Drugs or appliances are categorised by BNF (British National Formulary)</p>
        <p>Hover over a circle to see the category of items.</p>
        <p>The size of the circle represents the number of items prescribed for that category of items. Items are grouped by the broad section of the BNF in which they are classified.</p>
