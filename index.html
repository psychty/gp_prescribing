      <h1>GP Practice Prescribing - West Sussex</h1>
      <p>Information on the drugs or appliances prescribed by NHS services each month are available from NHS Digital under the Open Government Licence. This visualisation shows the number of items prescribed in 2018 for the three West Sussex CCGs combined.</p>
      <p>Presentation level means data is provided for each individual drug name, form and strength or size using categories in the British National Formulary (BNF). The data does not tell us about an individual prescription and doesn't contain any patient identifiable data, but it does give an indication on the prescribing patterns among primary care organisations.</p>
      <p>Data downloaded from EBN labs OpenPrescribing tool. OpenPrescribing.net, EBM DataLab, University of Oxford, 2019</p>

      <h2>Notes:</h2>
      <p>A prescription item refers to a single supply of a medicine, dressing or appliance prescribed on a prescription form. If a prescription form includes three medicines it is counted as three prescription items.</p><p>However, it should be noted that these figures do not give any indication of the length of treatment or quantity of medicine prescribed.</p>
      <p>The size of the circle represents the number of items prescribed for that category of items. Items are grouped by the broad section of the BNF in which they are classified.</p>
