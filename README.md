# GP Practice level prescribing - West Sussex

Analysis of GP prescribing data using openprescribing[dot]net

Information on the drugs and appliances prescribed by NHS services each month are available from NHS Digital under the Open Government Licence. This visualisation shows the number of items prescribed in 2018 for the three West Sussex CCGs combined.

Presentation level means data is provided for each individual drug name, form and strength or size using categories in the British National Formulary (BNF). The data does not tell us about an individual prescription and doesn't contain any patient identifiable data, but it does give an indication on the prescribing patterns among primary care organisations.
